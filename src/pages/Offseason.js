      <p>
        BoilerMake I: February 8-10th,  2014
      </p>

      <p>
        The first BoilerMake started as a group of students involved with Purdue
        Hackers created BoilerMake as an organization under the Undergraduate
        Student Board. The goal was to get students involved and throw a
        hackathon where everyone could come together and create. It was created
        to be a great way for students to interact informally with companies and
        proving their technical skills through development. There were around
        400 attendees from 18 schools and about 30 companies all within the same
        space of Purdueâ€™s gym.

      <p>
        BoilerMake II: Oct 17-19th, 2014
      </p>

      <p>
        BM II was the year of the badges, (description). Our venue changed to
        the Lambert Fieldhouse to accommodate the 500 hackers. We kept this
        number as the maximum to ensure that all the hackers and sponsors could
        fit into the same large room to interact and develop in.
      </p>

      <p>
        BoilerMake III: Oct 16-18th, 2015
      </p>

      <p>
        BM III was once again located in Lambert Fieldhouse. This year, we
        provided arcade games, bean bags, and opportunities for hackers to enjoy
        their full hackathon experience. We also provided a diverse hardware lab
        for students to experiment and build with a variety of technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        BoilerMake IV: January 20-22nd, 2017
      </p>
      <p>
        BM IV followed a space adventure theme as hackers became astronauts
        traveling through the stars. This event was once again held in the
        Cordova Recreational Sports Center among the basketball courts. 500
        students came together once again to create under space themed
        decorations, arcade games, interactive lego boards.
