    <p className="paragraph">
        BoilerMake is a hackathon that brings over 500 hackers from across the
        country under one roof for one incredible weekend.  As a team, our
        mission is to empower each and every hacker to build anything that
        they can imagine, and we’ll pull out all the stops to make sure that
        dream becomes a reality.  We find happiness in knowing that every
        hacker will walk out of our doors with memories that will last a
        lifetime.

        This year, 24 students from Purdue University
        have come together to host an unforgettable hackathon. All the work
        that has gone into planning this event—everything from setting up the
        venue to the annoying emails that we berate your inboxes with—was
        accomplished by somebody just like you.
    </p>
    <p className="paragraph">
        If this sort of stuff sounds like your thing, stay tuned for more
        updates! We’ll be looking for new people to help us throw another
        successful hackathon in 2018! As always - if you have any questions,
        feel free to hit us up at team@boilermake.org!

          The first BoilerMake started as a group of students involved with Purdue
          Hackers created BoilerMake as an organization under the Undergraduate
          Student Board. The goal was to get students involved and throw a hackathon
          where everyone could come together and create. It was created to be a
          great way for students to interact informally with companies and proving
          their technical skills through development. There were around 400 attendees
          from 18 schools and about 30 companies all within the same space of
          Purdue’s gym.

          BM II was the year of the badges, (description). Our venue changed to the
          Lambert Fieldhouse to accommodate the 500 hackers. We kept this number as
          the maximum to ensure that all the hackers and sponsors could fit into the
          same large room to interact and develop in.

          BM III was once again located in Lambert Fieldhouse. This year, we
          provided arcade games, bean bags, and opportunities for hackers to enjoy
          their full hackathon experience. We also provided a diverse hardware lab
          for students to experiment and build with a variety of technologies.

          together once again to create under space themed decorations, arcade
          games, interactive lego boards.
