      <p className="paragraph">
          Hey we’re the BoilerMake team!  You might be wondering who the heck
          we are, so let us tell you what we’re all about.  Our mission is
          simple: we want give back to hacker community by throwing one kickass
          hackathon.
      </p>
      <p className="paragraph">
          BoilerMake is a hackathon that brings over 500 hackers from across the
          country under one roof for one incredible weekend.  As a team, our
          mission is to empower each and every hacker to build anything that
          they can imagine, and we’ll pull out all the stops to make sure that
          dream becomes a reality.  We find happiness in knowing that every
          hacker will walk out of our doors with memories that will last a
          lifetime.
      </p>
      <p className="paragraph">
          This year, 24 completely different students from Purdue University
          have come together to host an unforgettable hackathon. All the work
          that has gone into planning this event—everything from setting up the
          venue to the annoying emails that we berate your inboxes with—was
          accomplished by somebody just like you.
      </p>
      <p className="paragraph">
          If this sort of stuff sounds like your thing, stay tuned for more
          updates! We’ll be looking for new people to help us throw another
          successful hackathon in 2018! As always - if you have any questions,
          feel free to hit us up at team@boilermake.org!
