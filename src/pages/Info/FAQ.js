    "body": "A hackathon is not somewhere that you come to hack the NSA, but rather a great place for people to come together to work on incredible projects. You'll be surrounded by a group of incredibly intelligent and creative people, as well as brilliant mentors from some of the largest tech companies across the country. Hackathons can serve as a great place to learn, and you may end up surprising yourself on what you can accomplish the end of the weekend."

    "body": "If your college has a large group of people and is within a reasonable distance of Purdue University, we may be able to provide a bus to transport you to Purdue. If transportation is going to be an issue, please contact us at <a href='mailto:team@boilermake.org'>team@boilermake.org</a> and we'll try to figure something out.
