          BoilerMake offers a number of perks to make an amazing weekend. To get
          the weekend started, we provide busses to a number of schools to make
          travelling a no-brainer. In the past, weâ€™ve sent buses to UIUC, UMich,
          and others.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you arrive, you will be given a swag bag that usually includes a
          t-shirt, a watter bottle, and stickers. Each year we have some special
          swag. BoilerMake 5 saw a fidget spinner. BoilerMake 2 saw a custom
          designed dev board.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout the weekend, we provide amazing catered meals for breakfast,
          lunch, and dinner. We also have an all you can drink coffee, latte, etc.
          bar and snacks passed out during the event.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the end we have an awards ceremony where over $10,000 in prizes are
          given out. Last year winning teams received DJI Phantoms or Nintendo
          Switches. In addition to BoilerMake prizes, sponsors also usually have
          prizes for their categories.
